Dear friends,

This is a simply data process program that is used to analysis the experiment of neutron spin flipper efficiency.
But I think the basic idea behind it can be used to process other nuclear experiment data.Even though here I didn't
add uncertainty analysis inside this program.

You can modify the whole environment path variables in read.py and wirte.py under directory of process/global_env.
I also put the definition of all tables (all_tables) under this directory. Feel free to change it as your necessary problem.

In docs, you can find a pdf file named as "block chart of processing program" that is used to instruct you how to use this program.
Almost all the modules should be used to run this program has been clearly marked. Hope it will help you. In addition, I also put
one ppt file named as "My personal data analysis method" to describe the background and procedure to process data.
